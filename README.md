# CS 131 HW 3
Explore performance and reliability of programs with looser consistency models. 

```
TODOs:
1. Implement State classes with relaxed synchronization and increased performance (speed)
2. Integrate all classes into a single program UnsafeMemory
3. For each class, measure/observe class's performance and reliability as described above 
    - Vary whether platform or virtual threads are used
    - Vary the state array size
    - Vary the number of threads
4. Compare the classes' reliability and performance to each other.
